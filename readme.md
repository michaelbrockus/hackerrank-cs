# HackerRank C-Sharp project

## About

* * *

The `HackerRank` project is a list of solutions for problems found on the
`HackerRank` website written in `C#`. It would be important to mention that
each solution is stored in its own git branch, so the best way to view the
written solutions for their corresponding problem can be done by switching
git branches.

This project is using *Meson build system*, so be sure to review
[The Absolute Beginner's Guide to Installing and Using Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/SimpleStart.html)
then see if you can build this project to prove that everything is all
setup and ready to go. :)
